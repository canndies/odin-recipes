    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>If you want to show your work (the project) to others, or submit a solution below, you will need to publish your
        site so that others can access it from the web, rather than just on your local machine. The good news is that if
        you have your project on GitHub (as described above), doing this is incredibly simple</p>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
